# FileLoader Class Overview

The FileLoader class is designed to handle the ingestion and processing of JSON files into a PostgreSQL database. It contains methods for database operations, file processing, data ingestion, and error handling.

## Initialization and Setup

### __init__ Method

Initializes instance attributes such as facility_id, syncfile_entryID, demo_path, count_of_df, load_end_time, and load_start_time.

## Database Operations

### _db_connect Method

Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using connection parameters specified in the method. It returns both a database connection (conn) and an SQLAlchemy engine (engine).

### _db_connect_filedb Method

Establishes a connection to a separate PostgreSQL database (filedb) for file-related operations.

### _get_and_map_cols Method

Retrieves column information (column name and data type) from the database for a specified table. It constructs a dictionary (column_mapping) mapping column names to data types and a list (column_list) of column names.

## File Processing

### _retrieve_localdir_from_syncfile Method

Retrieves files from the sync file in the file database (filedb) for processing. It fetches file metadata including id, facility_id, and decrypted_file_name.

### _process_derive_tablename Method

Processes a file path to derive a corresponding table name based on the file name. It splits the file name, filters out non-digit parts, and joins the remaining parts to form the table name.

### _process_file_by_name Method

Processes each file retrieved from the sync file. It checks if the file has been previously loaded successfully or failed, and accordingly inserts log entries and updates sync file flags. If the file has not been loaded or failed previously, it ingests the data into the database.

## Data Ingestion

### _replace_empty_strings_with_null Method

Replaces empty strings or spaces with NaN (null) values in a Pandas DataFrame (df).

### _ingest_json_data Method

Ingests JSON data from a file into a staging table in the database. It reads the JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame, processes the data, and ingests it into the specified staging table using SQLAlchemy.

## Error Handling and Logging

### _check_if_previouslyloaded and _check_if_faillogged Methods

Check if a file has been previously loaded successfully or failed based on its file name and facility ID.

### Error Handling in _process_file_by_name Method

Catches exceptions during file processing, such as UnicodeDecodeError and ProgrammingError. It handles each error type differently and updates log entries accordingly.

### Logging Updates in _update_log and _update_flag_syncfile Methods

Updates log entries in the database for file ingestion, including the start time, end time, status, error message, and record count.

## Conclusion
The FileLoader class encapsulates various methods and processes for efficiently ingesting and processing JSON files into a PostgreSQL database. It handles database connections, file retrieval, data ingestion, error handling, and logging, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the ingestion process.
